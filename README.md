### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Neil, a first year MS CS student at [Stanford](www.stanford.edu) studying computer science. I recently graduated [Columbia University](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/) with a BS in CS. In the past, I was a part of Apple's Human Interface Devices (HID), CoreMotion, and Motion Fitness teams as a software engineer and applied scientist, focusing on computer vision and modeling. I was a researcher at Columbia AI and Robotics lab [(CAIR)](https://cair.cs.columbia.edu/) , adviced by Prof. [Shuran Song](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~shurans/index.html). 

My background is in deep learning, LLMs, computer vision and robot learning.
